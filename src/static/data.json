  "philosophy": "Hello. I\u2019m Lo. I practice what can be called \u201Cpsychological\u201D tarot. This means I see tarot as a tool to help you gain insights on your thoughts and situation, to find answers within yourself, and not as an artefact that gives you magical answers. \r\n\r\nI also believe that we should all be in charge of our own narrative. As such, while I will help you understand the meaning of the cards and how they might interact together, I will also invite you to share with me as little or as much as you like about what the cards may elicit in you, and let to your decision how much you\u2019d like me to help you weave your story with the cards\u2019 meanings.\r\n\r\nWe will go over all this in our first session, and any question you may have. You\u2019re also welcome to email me if you have any question regarding the sessions or my practice.",
  "readings": "I use Rider-Waite tarot decks, from various illustrators.\r\n\r\nReadings can be structured around anything from a general question to specific question(s), depending on what you would like to discuss. Since I do not tell fortune but read \u201Cpsychological\u201D tarot, I would encourage you to think about open questions which invite you to reflection rather than closed questions that would call for yes \/ no answers, dates, etc. If you\u2019re unsure about how to formulate a question, we can always think about it together during a session.\r\n\r\nI use both classic tarot spreads and custom ones that I build during the session, to adapt the reading to your question.",
  "sessions": "I try to keep the number of sessions I do every week quite low, to make sure that you will have my undivided attention, energy and passion engaged with you. If the open times really don\u2019t work for you, you\u2019re welcome to email me with your other availabilities. But I would prefer to stick to the times available and cannot guarantee that I will be free to work with you at other times.\r\n\r\nAll sessions are online, via Zoom call. Off-line sessions may be arranged if you are based in London. Please email to discuss.\r\n\r\nPrice: \u00A385 for a 45 min session.",
  "confidentiality": "Our meetings are strictly confidential and I will never reveal their content, unless I am led to believe that you may hurt yourself or someone else. I am not a qualified therapist, so if you think that you might need professional help, I would recommend that you go see a medical professional."
